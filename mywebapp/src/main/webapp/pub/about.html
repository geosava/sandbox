        <h1>About this sandbox</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>
            A key challenge for all businesses in our digitally driven economy is their endeavor to build an IT
            infrastructure that is both
            <span class="term">widely open</span> to the benefits of the constantly evolving number of the SaaS
            offerings and at the same time
            <span class="term">tightly closed</span> to the security risks that come together with the internet
            territory. Additionally,
            the businesses of all sizes should take similar balancing decisions on the appropriate levels of outsourcing
            and
            ownership:
            should they develop in-house and own more, or should they outsource everything and own less?
        </p>

        <p>
            This demo web application aspires to be <span class="term">inspirational</span> on this matter
            using web4thejob and a number of other free on line services.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>
            Let’s assume you’re a web4thejob Community developer who needs to have a web based Personal Organizer for
            keeping track of your projects and following
            the activities of the web4thejob Community. You also want to have the application installed on the cloud so
            that it is constantly accessible from
            either your laptop or your tablet. Finally, you want to be able to create user accounts with limited access
            for the people you either work with or
            work for.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>
            This sandbox aspires to solve the aforementioned problem by topping web4thejob’s intrinsic functionality
            with 1 <a class="link" href="http://wiki.web4thejob.org/miscel/glossary/joblet" target="_blank">joblet</a>
            and 1
            <a class="link" href="http://web4thejob.org/f-a-q/34-what-is-a-plugin" target="_blank">plugin</a>. The
            joblet dubbed
            <strong>“myprojects”</strong> provides the <a class="link" href="joblets.html">relation schema</a> that will
            host your business data, while the plugin named <strong>
            “mycalendar”</strong> facilitates a flexible calendar view of your agenda similar to that of Google
            Calendar. A second joblet dubbed <strong>“mydocumentation”</strong> is also installed but its purpose is
            strictly educational,
            i.e. it embeds a dynamic help bar at the right hand-side of the screen that provides on-line help based on
            your actions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sandbox demonstrates the coupling of various public data services (e.g. twitter and github timelines,
            google maps frames, a countdown clock from
            countdown.org and incorporation of numerous other web pages) with the private business data of your
            application. All these are glued together nicely
            by the sophisticated panel-based UI engine of web4thejob and safeguarded by its flexible security policies.
            This way you remain the sole owner of your business sources (i.e. the joblet) and its
            data to change them as you see fit.
        </p>

        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Note: </span> All changes in this sandbox are cleaned frequently by
            an automated procedure.
            Therefore you are encouraged to experiment with the application as much as you like.
            However, if you catch yourself messing with the configuration too much, or notice some unexpected behavior
            while using the sandbox online, consider <a class="link" href="http://sf.net" target="_blank">downloading a
                private copy</a>
            of this sandbox so that the changes you perform will not impact the experience of others and vice versa.
        </p>

        <h2>The User Accounts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3 id="manager">manager</h3>
                This is a full access user account that is authorized to read and write on all entities without
                exceptions.
                The account is also authorized to start the design of new panels and to modify any of the existing ones.
                If this is your first time here <strong>definitely start with this account</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><h3 id="viewer">viewer</h3>
                This is a read only access user account. This means that while it is authorized to access the same
                information as <span class="term">manager</span>,
                the permission for it to insert, update and delete entities has been revoked throughout the application.
                The purpose of this account is to demonstrate some of the security features that web4thejob offers
                out-of-the-box.
            </li>
            <li><h3 id="guest">guest</h3>
                This is an even more restrictive account meaning that on top of the fact that all insert, update and
                delete permissions have been revoked,
                it's user menu has suffered significant limitations, thus leaving accessible only a small subset of
                panels in accordance with a low clearance guest profile.
                Once more, the purpose here is to demonstrate further the flexibility of the security engine that comes
                with web4thejob
            </li>
            <li><h3 id="admin">admin</h3>
                This is the framework's built-in full access administrative account.
                No limitation can ever be imposed on this account.
                To sign in as <span class="term">admin</span>, first sign in as <span class="term">manager</span> or
                <span class="term">viewer</span> and then look for the User > About dialog.
            </li>
        </ul>
